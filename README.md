# IP Checker (Python version)

This simple dockerised python application polls an endpoint on the internet every 1 minute to see if my allocated IP provided by my ISP has changed. Why? Because unfortunately I get regular daily disconnections that I want to keep a track of. I could of course do this by looking at the router logs, but there is no real learning curve in doing it that way so I decided to write an application - first in Node and now in Python.
